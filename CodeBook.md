### Dictionary for the step_5_tidy_data.txt dataset:

See README file for more information and attribution to the data's source.

[1] subject_id: ID of the study participant; integer [1:30]

[2] activity_name: activity performed by participant while feature data was captured; factor "LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"

Review the dataset's features_info.txt file for information about each variable below.  In this dataset, each variable below is the mean value of each measurement by subject_id and activity_name.
